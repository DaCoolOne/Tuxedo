# Tuxedo
Tuxedo is a 1s-Specific Rocket League bot made to work on the RLBot framework.

To Run, first install the latest version of RLBot using the instructions fround on the official RlBot website. http://www.rlbot.org/ Then, clone this repository to your local machine. You should now be able to open the RLBot framework and run the bot in your own matches. In the RLBot GUI, add a new bot, select the type to be "rlbot", and for the Agent Preset select "tuxedo_config.cfg". Start the match and have fun!

Note: Using appearence overrides with this bot is not recommended. The bot is fine-tuned to use the dominus as its car, and using other vehicles may mess with the ability of the bot to play the game.
